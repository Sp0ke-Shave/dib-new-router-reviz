Revisualising speed tests from new router from data is beautiful.

This post on reddit had a really good spreadsheet summary of some router testing. 

I wanted to do it with a visualisation to summarise the results in a different way. 

Starting by re-entering the data in a tidy way in ta text file. 

I re-wrangled the data a couple of ways but finally decided the best way to present it on was old-vs new point plot. 

I combined the different conditions to facet out the diffierent conditions.
